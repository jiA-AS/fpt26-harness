"""Credit-based tool-invocation budget.

Every metered tool call (csim / synth / cosim) costs credits weighted by its
typical wall-clock cost. The agent must reach correctness and optimize PPA
before the credit pool runs dry. A charge that would overrun raises
BudgetExceeded, which the agent loop treats as a hard stop.
